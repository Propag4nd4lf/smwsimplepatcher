# SWM Simple Patcher

With this tool you will be able to download and patch SWM roms really easy and fast.


## How to Install?

Get SMW Simple Patcher by downloading [the latest release](https://github.com/Propag4nd4lf/smwsimplepatcher/releases). It's currently only supported on Windows, but the source code should work on both MacOS and Linux __(but I have not tested it yet!)__.

```
1  - Update the database.
2. - Download the essential files.
3. - Set an output folder.
4a - Select the hack and press "Download And Patch ROM".
4b - You can alternatively select multiple hacks to download/patch them all at once if you need to.
```
